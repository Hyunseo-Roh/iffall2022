    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol style="margin-top: 8px">
        <li class="instrutions">To make the seasoning paste for pork, combine chili paste, chili flakes, soy sauce, rice wine, sugar, garlic, ginger puree, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and black pepper in a small mixing bowl; mix well.</li>
        <li class="instrutions">In a large mixing bowl, separate each slice of pork and put them in a bowl.<br> Add the seasoning paste and mix well (Wearing a disposable food glove is helpful).<br> You can make this step ahead of time and let it marinate in the refrigerator up to 24 hrs. Or you can go straight to stir-fry without marinating at all.</li>
        <li class="instrutions">Heat 2 tablespoon of oil in a deep skillet or wok over high heat.<br> Add 2 teaspoon of sugar and swirl the pan around.<br> Let the sugar turn brown and caramelized.</li>
        <li class="instrutions">Quickly add the chopped Asian leek (or green onion) and stir-fry for 30 seconds to infuse the oil.<br> Add pork and onion.<br> Stir-fry pork and onion until they are fully cooked and tender, about 3-4 minutes.<br> Serve immediately with rice and lettuce (if desired).</li>
        &#42;<b>Note:</b> If your skillet is not big enough to stir-fry the entire batch of pork, divide the pork in half or in portion you desire.<br> If so, you will need to reduce the amount of oil, sugar, and leek to caramelize per batch accordingly.

    <h3 style="text-decoration: none; margin-bottom: 10px;">Tips:</h3>
    <p style="margin-top: 10px"><u>What to eat with:</u> Just like other stir-fried dishes, Jeyuk Bokkeum tastes best when it is hot. Try with lettuce and Kkaennip (Korean perilla leaves), and some rice. Most Korean households serve this pork bulgogi with Doenjnag Jjigae (Korean soybean paste stew) as an accompaniment, but that is totally optional.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 1px"><u>Meal prep:</u> once cooled, store the cooked pork bulgogi in an airtight container for up to 4 days in the fridge.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 1px"><u>Freezer:</u> Korean beef bulgogi can be marinated and frozen (uncooked) in an airtight container or freezer-bag for up to 2 months. Thaw overnight in the fridge before cooking.</p>
