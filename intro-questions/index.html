            <h1>Introductory questions</h1>
            <p>1. My name is Hyunseo Roh. I'm a Junior and studying Communication Design.</p>
            <p>2. I have no basement about using HTML/CSS or something related to coding. 
                I want to learn skills and information about coding and hope for making my own website after this class.</p>
            <p>3. I don't have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS.</p>
            <p>4. I hope to gain more knowledge and be familiar with making websites using HTML or CSS.</p>
            <p>5. Compare to designing for paper, designing for the screen is more flexible which means it can be edited in various ways like delete or copy and paste. 
                Moreover, these days, since most people use the internet it is easier to transport via the internet by designing for screen.</p>
            <p>6. <a href="https://www.tdp-arch.com"> Torgerson Design Partners</a> exemplifies the effective design. 
                It is visually appealing, polished, and professional by showing dynamic movements with their instructions. These animated transition effects keep people moving and take navigation an interactive experience.</p>
            <p>7. I used to book my flight through <a href="https://www.delta.com"> Delta Air Lines</a>. 
                It creates a clear message to visitors as we can just insert the date, departure, and arrival to book the flight. It has a clear dark blue background with white text on it so it makes the visitors see it neatly.</p>
            <p>8. <a href="https://www.spotify.com"> Spotify</a> shows well in design aspects. 
                It shows the simplicity of considering the user experience and the usability of the website with a neat black background. The website's visual appeal contributes to its brand awareness by showing albums with short theme instructions.</p>
