            Do you love the rain, does it make you dance<br>
            When you're drunk with your friends at a party?<br>
            What's your favorite song, does it make you smile?<br>
            Do you think of me?
            </p>
         
            <p>
            When you close your eyes<br>
            Tell me, what are you dreamin'?<br>
            Everything, I wanna know it all
            </p>

            <p> 
            I'd spend 10, 000 hours and 10, 000 more<br>
            Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours<br>
            And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try<br>
            If it's 10, 000 hours or the rest of my life<br>
            I'm gonna love you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)

            Do you miss the road that you grew up on?<br>
            Did you get your middle name from your grandma?<br>
            When you think about your forever now<br>
            Do you think of me?
            </p>
